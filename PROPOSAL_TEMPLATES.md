**Subject:** Alternative website package for [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I understand budget and timing are important considerations for any business investment.

If the original proposal doesn't fit your current needs, I have a few alternative packages that might work better:

**Option 1:** Starter package at $[Lower Amount]  
**Option 2:** Payment plan ($[Amount]/month for 3 months)  
**Option 3:** Phase 1 launch now, add features later  

Would any of these options work better for [Company Name]?

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

However, every day without a professional website means potential customers are choosing your competitors instead.

If you'd like to move forward, I'm here to help. If not, I completely understand and wish you the best with your business.

Thanks for considering my services.
