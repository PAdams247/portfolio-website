WHAT WAS NOT CHANGED
=================================================================

✓ WebDesignServices page structure - kept as-is
  (This page can serve as a side income source while job hunting)

✓ All CSS styling - no changes to purple gradients or glassmorphism
  (Will address design consistency after building new projects)

✓ Daily Planner, Games, Task List pages - no changes needed
  (These are functional projects, no outdated info)

✓ Contact information - already accurate

=================================================================
NEXT STEPS
=================================================================

1. Build CPI Tracker project (your most exciting idea!)
2. Build Budget Tracker project  
3. Add comprehensive READMEs to all GitHub projects
4. After projects are done, redesign portfolio for consistency
